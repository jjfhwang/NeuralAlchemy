# NeuralAlchemy: Crafting Intelligence with Python

NeuralAlchemy is a Python-based framework designed to facilitate the construction, training, and deployment of advanced neural network architectures. It provides a modular and extensible environment for experimenting with various deep learning techniques, from fundamental layers to complex generative models. The library aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application, offering a streamlined workflow for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts alike to harness the power of artificial intelligence.

This project emphasizes ease of use without sacrificing flexibility. NeuralAlchemy avoids imposing rigid structures, allowing users to tailor their models precisely to their needs. Whether you're building a convolutional neural network for image classification, a recurrent neural network for natural language processing, or a generative adversarial network for creating synthetic data, NeuralAlchemy provides the essential building blocks and a clear, intuitive API to bring your ideas to life. The focus is on providing a transparent and understandable implementation, enabling users to deeply understand the inner workings of each component and easily customize them for specific tasks. We aim to empower users not just to use existing models, but to innovate and create new ones.

NeuralAlchemy is built with performance in mind. While prioritizing readability and maintainability, we employ efficient computational techniques and leverage optimized libraries to ensure that models train effectively and execute swiftly. The framework is designed to be easily integrated with hardware acceleration solutions, enabling users to take full advantage of GPUs for faster training and inference. Furthermore, the modular architecture promotes code reuse and simplifies the process of building complex, multi-faceted AI systems. By focusing on clear abstractions and well-defined interfaces, NeuralAlchemy empowers developers to build robust and scalable solutions for a wide range of applications.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Layer Definitions:** Each neural network layer (e.g., Convolutional, Dense, Recurrent) is implemented as a self-contained module, allowing for easy customization and integration. For example, a custom activation function can be implemented and swapped in with minimal code changes.
*   **Dynamic Computation Graph:** NeuralAlchemy utilizes a dynamic computation graph, enabling flexible model construction and debugging. This allows for modifications to the model architecture at runtime, supporting advanced techniques like reinforcement learning and neural architecture search.
*   **Automatic Differentiation:** The framework provides automatic differentiation capabilities, simplifying the process of training complex models. Gradients are computed automatically, eliminating the need for manual derivation and implementation.
*   **Customizable Training Loops:** Users have full control over the training process, including the optimization algorithm, learning rate schedule, and evaluation metrics. This provides the flexibility needed to fine-tune models for specific tasks and datasets.
*   **Serialization and Deserialization:** Trained models can be easily saved to and loaded from disk, enabling efficient deployment and reuse. The serialization format is designed to be both compact and platform-independent.
*   **GPU Acceleration Support:** NeuralAlchemy seamlessly integrates with CUDA-enabled GPUs for accelerated training and inference. The framework automatically detects and utilizes available GPU resources, maximizing performance.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** The framework is designed to be easily extended with new layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms. This allows users to adapt NeuralAlchemy to their specific research needs and contribute to the project's growth.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing NeuralAlchemy.
*   **NumPy:** A fundamental library for numerical computation in Python, providing efficient array operations and mathematical functions. This is used extensively for tensor manipulation.
*   **SciPy:** An open-source Python library for scientific computing and technical computing.
*   **CUDA (Optional):** Enables GPU acceleration for faster training and inference. Requires a CUDA-compatible GPU and the CUDA toolkit.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    `git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/NeuralAlchemy.git`
    `cd NeuralAlchemy`

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    `python3 -m venv venv`
    `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS)
    `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.  **(Optional) Install CUDA:** If you want to use GPU acceleration, install the CUDA toolkit from NVIDIA's website and ensure that the CUDA environment variables are properly configured. The framework will automatically detect and utilize CUDA if it is available.

## Configuration

NeuralAlchemy utilizes environment variables for certain configurations.

*   `NEURALALCHEMY_DEVICE`: Specifies the device to use for computation (e.g., "cpu" or "cuda"). If not set, the framework will attempt to use CUDA if available, otherwise it will default to the CPU.
*   `NEURALALCHEMY_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level (e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR"). Defaults to "INFO".

These variables can be set in your shell environment or in a `.env` file located in the project root directory.

# NeuralAlchemy: Bayesian Meta-Learning for Neuromorphic Continual Adaptation

NeuralAlchemy is a Python-based framework implementing a novel neuromorphic agent leveraging Bayesian meta-learning and reservoir computing to address the challenges of sparse reinforcement signals and continual adaptation in dynamic environments. This project offers a unique approach to building intelligent agents capable of learning and adapting with minimal supervision, drawing inspiration from the efficiency and plasticity of biological neural networks.

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of a reservoir computing-based agent that incorporates Bayesian meta-learning to optimize its learning process. The agent is designed to learn across a distribution of tasks, enabling it to quickly adapt to new environments and tasks with limited data, particularly when reinforcement signals are sparse. The meta-learning component allows the agent to learn a prior over the reservoir's parameters, facilitating rapid adaptation and improved generalization performance. The neuromorphic architecture, based on reservoir computing, provides a computationally efficient framework for processing temporal sequences and extracting relevant features from the environment. The framework emphasizes continual adaptation, enabling the agent to learn and refine its behavior over time without forgetting previously learned information, a common issue in traditional reinforcement learning algorithms.

The core innovation of NeuralAlchemy lies in its integration of Bayesian meta-learning with a reservoir computing architecture. This combination enables the agent to efficiently learn a meta-prior over the reservoir's parameters, allowing for rapid adaptation to new tasks. By leveraging the inherent dynamics of the reservoir, the agent can process temporal sequences and extract relevant features from the environment. Furthermore, the Bayesian framework provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification, allowing the agent to make informed decisions even when faced with limited data. The agent is designed to be robust to sparse reinforcement signals, making it suitable for real-world scenarios where feedback is often limited or delayed.

NeuralAlchemy aims to advance the field of reinforcement learning by providing a practical and efficient solution for building intelligent agents capable of continual adaptation. The framework is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing researchers and developers to easily incorporate new features and algorithms. It provides a valuable platform for exploring the potential of neuromorphic computing and Bayesian meta-learning for solving complex real-world problems.

## Key Features

*   **Bayesian Meta-Learning:** Implements a Bayesian meta-learning framework to learn a prior distribution over the reservoir's parameters, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. This involves techniques like variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over hyperparameters.
*   **Reservoir Computing Architecture:** Employs a reservoir computing architecture, characterized by a fixed, randomly initialized recurrent neural network (the reservoir) and a trainable readout layer. This architecture provides a computationally efficient way to process temporal sequences.
*   **Sparse Reinforcement Signal Handling:** Designed to effectively learn from sparse reinforcement signals by incorporating exploration strategies and reward shaping techniques. The agent utilizes intrinsic motivation to explore the environment and discover informative states.
*   **Continual Adaptation:** Enables the agent to continuously learn and adapt to new environments without forgetting previously learned information. This is achieved through techniques like regularization and replay buffers to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
*   **Modular Design:** The framework is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy customization and extension. Different components, such as the reservoir, readout layer, and meta-learning algorithm, can be easily swapped out or modified.
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Includes tools for hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the agent's performance. Techniques such as Bayesian optimization and grid search can be used to find the optimal hyperparameters for a given task.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification using the Bayesian framework, allowing the agent to make informed decisions even when faced with limited data. The uncertainty estimates can be used to guide exploration and improve decision-making.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the entire framework.
*   **NumPy:** A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, used for array manipulation and linear algebra operations.
*   **SciPy:** A library for scientific computing, providing a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions.
*   **TensorFlow/PyTorch (choose one):** A deep learning framework used for implementing the reservoir computing architecture and meta-learning algorithms. The code should be adaptable to either, with clear instructions for each.
*   **Gymnasium (formerly Gym):** A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, used for defining the environments the agent interacts with.
*   **Optuna:** A framework for hyperparameter optimization, allowing for efficient tuning of the agent's performance.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/NeuralAlchemy.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    cd NeuralAlchemy

3.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows

4.  Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Note: The `requirements.txt` file should contain all necessary dependencies, including NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Gymnasium, and Optuna.

## Configuration

The agent's behavior can be configured using environment variables and configuration files. A sample `config.ini` file should be provided in the repository, allowing users to customize parameters such as:

*   Reservoir size
*   Reservoir connectivity
*   Learning rate
*   Meta-learning hyperparameters
*   Exploration strategy parameters
*   Reward shaping parameters

Environment variables can be used to override the values specified in the configuration file. For example:

export RESERVOIR_SIZE=500 # Linux/macOS
set RESERVOIR_SIZE=500 # Windows

The code should include functions to load and parse the configuration file, as well as retrieve environment variables.

## Usage

The main entry point for running the agent is `main.py`. To train the agent on a specific environment, use the following command:

python main.py --env CartPole-v1 --config config.ini

This will train the agent on the CartPole-v1 environment using the configuration specified in the `config.ini` file. The `--env` argument specifies the environment to use, and the `--config` argument specifies the configuration file to use.

The API documentation for the core classes and functions should be provided in the code using docstrings. This documentation can be generated using tools like Sphinx. Provide clear and concise explanations of the purpose, inputs, and outputs of each function and class. Example code snippets should be included to illustrate how to use the API.
